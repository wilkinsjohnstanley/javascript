/*
Yes, there are some beginner-friendly LeetCode problems that can be solved or partially solved using the rest operator (...). 
The rest operator is used for handling variable numbers of elements or objects, and 
it's especially useful when working with arrays and objects. Here are a few such problems:

1. Concatenation of Arrays

Problem:
Given an array nums, your task is to concatenate the array to itself.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]

Solution with Spread Operator:
*/
var getConcatenation = function(nums) {
    return [...nums, ...nums];
};
`
2. Merge Sorted Array

Problem:
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Example:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

Solution with Spread Operator:
`
var merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {
    nums1.splice(0, m + n, ...[...nums1.slice(0, m), ...nums2].sort((a, b) => a - b));
};
/*
3. Two Sum

Problem:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

Solution:
Although this problem is traditionally solved using a map or loops, 
you can use the spread operator to make shallow copies of arrays for further processing:
*/
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    const numsCopy = [...nums];
    for (let i = 0; i < numsCopy.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - numsCopy[i];
        const index = numsCopy.indexOf(complement);
        if (index !== -1 && index !== i) {
            return [i, index];
        }
    }
};
`
4. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences

Problem:
You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a sentence. 
Return the maximum number of words found in a single sentence.

Example:
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i love coding", "hello world"]
Output: 5

Solution:
`
var mostWordsFound = function(sentences) {
    return Math.max(...sentences.map(sentence => sentence.split(' ').length));
};
/*
The rest and spread operators are particularly useful in 
array concatenation, object merging, and when working with destructuring. 
These LeetCode problems will help reinforce these concepts!
